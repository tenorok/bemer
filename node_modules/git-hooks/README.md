# git-hooks as npm package

It's a [git-hooks](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks) wrapper allowing to install it using npm.

This wrapper runs `git-hooks --install` after installing npm package and `git-hooks --unistall` â€” after unsitalling. 
So you don't need to run `git-hooks` manually.

## Install
**Note.** It should be installed as a local package and it would work only for git repositories.
```
npm install git-hooks
```
